Allstimuliasjpg: all the pictures of the stimuli in the Spatial Reasoning Study quiz. Primarily used as reference images to compare with CV and to manually analyze contours. 

alternative_data: original data and variations of combining data for processing. not used, but the data that is used is with the code and is a variation of this data

contours: code-generated images derived from images from Allstimuliasjpg -- shows contours of the stimuli and where they are located. The "Selected" folder is images currently of interest due to potential significance.  

extra_exploratory_code: other ideas that can still be useful that came up in researching and brainstorming 

google_collab_related: code and data and was used and produced during the initial few weeks of Spring Quarter 2022, where we were doing some initial analysis using statistics and feature extration via decision tree. Also was trying to implement letter detection in the gaze path shape of gaze data chunks. 

notes: notes taken during the process of creating the next iteration. 

og_code_and_dependent_files: code that Marcelo wrote and files that the code is dependent on. Other files are dependent on that code, but it is located with the current working code if the code is relevant to the current iteration. Current iteration is derived from this code. Some code may still be useful in understanding the underlying structure in the code process for the current iteration. Also can be useful just to create data to help analyze results/test for code correctness in the current iteration. 

portfolio_stimuli: reference images for the building part of Minecraft. Used to detect the images in video using CV. 

processed_videos: all videos in our current data with gaze data overlayed on them. 

sample_io: files used during initial exploration of og_code to how the code runs. 

video_coding: data produced during manual coding of videos. (looking at the sequence the participant looks at quadrants of the stimuli image -- 1 is top left quadrant, 2 is top right, 3 is bottom left, 4 is bottom right)
